I'm interested in both fundamental deep learning research as well as developing computer vision technology to help tackle today's global challenges. My main research interests include representation learning, equivariant CNNs and efficient color encoding in neural networks.

Besides that, I also enjoy (kite)surfing, hiking and playing the guitar.

If you're interested to collaborate, feel free to drop me an email.
