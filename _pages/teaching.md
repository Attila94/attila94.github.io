**Useful tools**

* **[Paper writing guidelines](https://jvgemert.github.io/writing.pdf)** *by Dr. Jan C. van Gemert*  
 Useful guidelines by my PhD supervisor for writing a scientific paper.

* **[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org)**  
 My personal favorite for organizing scientific articles. Tip: sync your library across multiple devices through an external cloud service (e.g. [SurfDrive](https://www.surf.nl/en/store-and-share-your-files-securely-in-the-cloud-with-surfdrive)) for free extended storage space (Zotero offers 300MB).

* **[Typora](https://www.typora.io)**  
 Super sleek MarkDown editor that supports math using Tex syntax and exports to PDF, HTML, LaTeX and more. Ideal for taking notes or keeping a log.
