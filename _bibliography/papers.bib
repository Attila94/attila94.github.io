      title={Zero-Shot Day-Night Domain Adaptation With a Physics Prior}, 
      author={Attila Lengyel and Sourav Garg and Michael Milford and Jan van Gemert},
      abstract={We explore the zero-shot setting for day-night domain adaptation. The traditional domain adaptation setting is to train on one domain and adapt to the target domain by exploiting unlabeled data samples from the test set. As gathering relevant test data is expensive and sometimes even impossible, we remove any reliance on test data imagery and instead exploit a visual inductive prior derived from physics-based reflection models for domain adaptation. We cast a number of color invariant edge detectors as trainable layers in a convolutional neural network and evaluate their robustness to illumination changes. We show that the color invariant layer reduces the day-night distribution shift in feature map activations throughout the network. We demonstrate improved performance for zero-shot day to night domain adaptation on both synthetic as well as natural datasets in various tasks, including classification, segmentation and place recognition.},

  title={Exploiting Learned Symmetries in Group Equivariant Convolutions},
  author={Attila Lengyel and Jan van Gemert},
  abstract={Group Equivariant Convolutions (GConvs) enable convolutional neural networks to be equivariant to various transformation groups, but at an additional parameter and compute cost. We investigate the filter parameters learned by GConvs and find certain conditions under which they become highly redundant. We show that GConvs can be efficiently decomposed into depthwise separable convolutions while preserving equivariance properties and demonstrate improved performance and data efficiency on two datasets. All code is publicly available at github.com/Attila94/SepGroupPy.},

    abstract={We present the first edition of "VIPriors: Visual Inductive Priors for Data-Efficient Deep Learning" challenges. We offer four data-impaired challenges, where models are trained from scratch, and we reduce the number of training samples to a fraction of the full set. Furthermore, to encourage data efficient solutions, we prohibited the use of pre-trained models and other transfer learning techniques. The majority of top ranking solutions make heavy use of data augmentation, model ensembling, and novel and efficient network architectures to achieve significant performance increases compared to the provided baselines.},
