  title={Exploiting Learned Symmetries in Group Equivariant Convolutions},
  author={Attila Lengyel and Jan C. van Gemert},
  abstract={Group Equivariant Convolutions (GConvs) enable convolutional neural networks to be equivariant to various transformation groups, but at an additional parameter and compute cost. We investigate the filter parameters learned by GConvs and find certain conditions under which they become highly redundant. We show that GConvs can be efficiently decomposed into depthwise separable convolutions while preserving equivariance properties and demonstrate improved performance and data efficiency on two datasets. All code is publicly available at github.com/Attila94/SepGroupPy.},

    author={Robert-Jan Bruintjes and Attila Lengyel and Marcos Baptista Rios and Osman Semih Kayhan and Jan van Gemert},
    abstract={We present the first edition of "VIPriors: Visual Inductive Priors for Data-Efficient Deep Learning" challenges. We offer four data-impaired challenges, where models are trained from scratch, and we reduce the number of training samples to a fraction of the full set. Furthermore, to encourage data efficient solutions, we prohibited the use of pre-trained models and other transfer learning techniques. The majority of top ranking solutions make heavy use of data augmentation, model ensembling, and novel and efficient network architectures to achieve significant performance increases compared to the provided baselines.},
